Dairy Island — Website for a Local Dairy Company

A web project developed during my and my classmate's production internship for a local dairy company, “Молочный остров” (Dairy Island).
The goal of this project was to create a clean, modern, and functional website that represents the company’s brand and products while improving user accessibility and engagement.

Design

All design layouts, color palettes, and interface components were created by me and my classmate in Figma, following the company’s branding guidelines.
